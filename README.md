# Landing-Page
Landing-Page Design Template
This React landing page template designed to have quick, responsive and professional landing page for their business or project.

This React template comes with multi-lingual support, smooth animations, set of ready to use sections and most importantly, all of the content is stored in the JSON files, so that you can manage the texts without having any prior knowledge in React.js.


# Features
This project has everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:

🎁 Modern – Template created using the latest features of React (State management using Hooks, Code-Splitting to reduce the bundle size)

🏷 Responsive – Highly responsive and reusable UI components, that change depending on the provided props

🚀 Fast – Buttery smooth experience thanks to the implementation of best practices and no third party dependencies, resulting in PERFECT Google Lighthouse scores

🌍 Internationalization - Prebuilt standalone file that works in every environment and doesn't require reloading the page to translate the content

🛸 Routing - Each file inside the src/pages directory will generate its own route, so you don't have to manually handle the routing

🤙 Contact Form - Contact form written in React Hooks, with uncontrolled form validation to reduce unnecessary performance penalty. You just need to provide the endpoint

⚙️ Maintenance - All of the content is stored in the JSON files, so that you can easily manage the content of the website

# Installation
You’ll need to have Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). I recommend using the latest LTS version.

To create a new app, you have to:

```
clone the repo locally
cd my-app
npm start
```
